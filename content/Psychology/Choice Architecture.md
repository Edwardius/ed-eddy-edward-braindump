# Choice Architecture
How the way choices are presented affect how they are chosen.

**Key:** There is no such thing as a neutral presentation of choices.

# Structuring a Choice Task: What to Present?
## How many Choices
- **more choices** means **better preference match** but **greater cognitive burden**
	- Insurance: 100 options overwhelms
	- Medicare Drug Plans: Too many choices
- **too few choices** can cause the presence of one choice to influence the presence of another choice
- **generally, 4 to 5 non-dominating choices seem like the sweet spot**

## Technology and Decision Aids
**Decision aids** are things that help with making decisions like google search and recommendation algorithms.
- secretly bias you to stick with your own world of stuff
- helps with filtering choices nonetheless
- can be designed to subtly steer consumers towards specific themes of choices (a handful of filter options that subtly make you eat a salad)

## Defaults
**A choice you can choose without having to actively choose it.** Whatever happens when you do nothing.

THE DOING NOTHING OPTION IS OFTEN CHOSEN MORE.
### Types of Defaults
1. **Simple Defaults** one default for everyone
2. **Random Defaults** different people get randomly different pre-selected options
3. **Forced Choice** - *no default*; must actively choose (heads or tails?)
4. **Sensory Defaults** change based on what can be inferred (phone detects you're driving - default option switches to do not disturb)
5. **Persistent Defaults** remembers past choices (pizza order, and next order defaults to past order)
6. **Reverting Defaults** forget last changes (the next order defaults to the original default everytime)
7. **Predictive Defaults** intelligently alter based on user observation (thermostat detects time, default temp changes)

## Choice Over Time
Lots of choices lead to outcomes that unfold overtime. This could lead to some biases:
- **Myopia** bias for caring about the present more than later
- **Uncertainty about the future** focus too much on the uncertainties of life, failing to consider satisfactory choices
- **Unrealistic Optimism** too optimistic of the future

### Ways to address these biases

| Tool                            | How it Works                                                | Example                      |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Order of consideration          | Drawing attention to delayed options refocuses the decision | Show long term option first  |
| Focus on Satisficing            | Encourage the consideration of the "good enough" option     | leads to higher satisfaction |
| Limited time windows            | Giving deadlines makes the bias kinda go away               | expiration dates             |
| Translate to immediate outcomes | make future consequences feel immediate                     | calculating present value?   |
## Task Structure
How the way the choices are structured affect the way people explore and search through the options to reach a final decision.

### Single Choice vs Configuration Context

**Single Choice Context** is where you have to choose one things from a list
**Configuration Context** is where you can make multiple sequential decisions. This uses a different way of choice thinking.
#### **Consumers are more likely to choose defaults when bombarded with choices for the first choice.**

**Scenario A: Start with MANY options (interior color with 8 choices)**

1. First choice: Interior color (8 options) - requires mental effort, depletes cognitive resources
2. Second choice: Engine type (3 options) - **more likely to just pick the default**
3. Third choice: Sound system (3 options) - **more likely to just pick the default**

**Scenario B: Start with FEW options (engine type with 3 choices)**

1. First choice: Engine type (3 options) - easy, doesn't deplete much
2. Second choice: Sound system (3 options) - still have mental energy
3. Third choice: Interior color (8 options) - **less likely to pick default, more likely to actively choose**

**Called Decision Fatigue**
### Two Stage Search: Screening then Comparing

**Screening** eliminates alternatives based on some subset of attributes
**Comparing** make alternative-based comparisons among remaining options

If you screen out options based on a specific attribute, then choice makers will factor in that attribute in the available choices more.
- You focus the choice on just one thing like the ugliness of a car, then people will weigh choices more heavily on looks

### Search Costs and When to Stop Searching
Choices might be cut short because people might not know when to stop searching. Perceiving the cost of search to be too high.

## Describing Choice Options (HOW to Present)

### Partitioning Options and Attributes
How you divide options dramatically affects choice behaviour.

**Why?** partitioning choices into categories affects how we allocate our choices (assuming its a choice that can be allocated, like money or time)

### Naive Allocation, 1/n Heuristic
Assuming a choice where allocation is needed (like time, money, etc.), people tend to split their allocation evenly amongst the presented categories of the choices.

|Domain|Pattern|Research|
|---|---|---|
|**Investment**|Allocate 1/n of savings to each of n options in a 401(k) plan|Benartzi & Thaler 2001; Thaler & Sunstein 2008|
|**Consumption**|Seek variety when choosing multiple goods for future consumption|Read & Loewenstein 1995; Simonson 1990|
|**Time**|Favor spreading consumption over different time periods|Loewenstein & Prelec 1993|
|**Justice**|Favor equal allocation of benefits and burdens among individuals (unless compelling alternative criterion)|Messick 1993|
|**Probability**|Assign equal probabilities to each event that could occur|Fox & Clemen 2005; Fox & Rottenstreich 2003|
|**Importance weights**|Assign equal importance to each explicitly identified attribute|Weber et al. 1988|

### Designing Attributes
People choose between alternatives by weighting pros and con of different attributes. ​
**We can influence behaviour by making particular attributes more or less noticeable.**

1. **PARSIMONY** - Keep It Simple​
	- Too many attributes overwhelm → people focus on only one, ignore important info, make worse decisions​
	- Solution: Use smaller attribute sets, highlight most important​
	- Research: Decision-makers understand more and weigh information better with choices requiring less cognitive effort (moreso for people bad at math)​

2. **LINEARITY** - Fix Non-Linear Relationships​
	- Problem: Attributes often have non-linear relationship to objectives​

3. **COMPARABILITY** - Use Same Scale​
	- Annual subscriptions vs. monthly bills vs. per-use downloads​
	- Put on common scale for accurate comparison​

4. **EVALUABILITY** - Add Context to Numbers​
	- Break into categories (grades) or label endpoints as good/bad​
	- Example: EPA rates cars 1-10 for CO₂ (no one knows "good" levels)​
	- Why it works: Labels allow quick affective reactions​

5. **TRANSLATION & EXPANSION** - Make Impact Salient​
	- Translation: Map attribute to consequences (gas consumption → cost AND CO₂)​
	- Expansion: Change scale to enlarge differences (100 miles vs. 10,000 miles)​
	- Expanded attributes receive more weight in choice

## Implementation Issues

### 3.1 Individual Differences

**THE CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:** A nudge can have multiple effects that depend on characteristics of the decision-maker

**Why one-size-fits-all fails:**
#### Reason 1: **Energy Use Feedback**

**Intervention:** Inform households about their relative energy use compared to neighbors

**Average effect:** 2% decrease in energy usage

**BUT when broken down by political affiliation:**
- **Liberal households:** REDUCED consumption
- **Republican households:** INCREASED consumption

**Why the difference:** Presumably due to differences in environmental concerns (Costa & Kahn 2010)

**Lesson:** Same intervention can produce opposite effects in different populations

#### Reason 2: **The "Curse of Knowledge" Problem**

**What it is:** Choice architects may:
- Anchor first on what THEY themselves know or want
- Insufficiently adjust for OTHER people's knowledge levels or preferences
- Nickerson 1999, 2001

**Example:**
- Expert nutritionists design food labels assuming people understand concepts like "saturated fat"
- But many consumers don't know what saturated fat is or why it matters
- The label design reflects the designer's knowledge, not the user's

#### **The Solution: Test in Diverse Populations**

**Implication:** The intuitions of choice architects will not always be enough

**Best practice:**
- Test choice architectures in diverse populations of interest
- Don't rely solely on intuition
- Run experiments before full implementation
#### Reason 3: **What We Already Know About Individual Differences**

We can bring existing knowledge about individual differences to bear on choice architecture:

**Content domain differences:**
- **Cultural cognitions** important in environmental domains
- **Political ideology** affects response to messaging
- **Religious beliefs** may affect health decisions

**Decision problem type differences:**
- **Numeracy** critical in decisions with unfamiliar numeric information
- **Need for cognition** affects how people process detailed information
- **Risk tolerance** affects financial decisions
#### Reason 4: **Numeracy and Choice Architecture**

**What is numeracy:** Ability to understand and work with numbers

**Why it matters:** Series of studies showing numeracy interacts with how information is presented

##### **Finding 1: Cognitive Effort and Numeracy (Peters et al. 2006)**

**General principle:** Requiring less cognitive effort helps decision-makers understand more information and weigh important information better

**Numeracy interaction:** This is **PARTICULARLY TRUE** for less numerate consumers

**What this means for design:**
- Simplifying numeric information helps everyone
- Helps less numerate people MUCH more
- Don't assume everyone can handle complex calculations

##### **Finding 2: Affective Meaning and Numeracy (Peters et al. 2007, 2009)**

**Intervention:** Attach affective (emotional) meaning to numeric information
- Add evaluative labels (good/bad)
- Add color coding
- Add visual indicators

**Effects:**
- **For everyone:** Allows integration of MORE information into decisions
- **For less numerate people:** REDUCES reliance on less relevant emotional sources like mood states

**Mechanism:** Labels facilitate information processing by allowing affective reactions to be accessed more quickly

**Example:**
```
Without labels:          With labels:
CO2: 250 g/mile         CO2: 250 g/mile (7/10 - Good)
                        ↑ Emotional reaction accessed quickly
```

##### **Finding 3: Organizing Frameworks (Sagara 2009)**

**Intervention:** Use organizing framework (like a table or chart) to help consumers comprehend information

**For less numerate consumers:**

- ✅ **Better comprehension** of information SUMMARIZED in the framework
- ❌ **Worse comprehension** of information NOT in the framework

**Interpretation:** The framework focuses attention on what's included, but draws attention AWAY from what's excluded

##### **Finding 4: Number Comparisons**

**For highly numerate decision-makers:**

- May OVERUSE number comparisons when such information is provided
- Focus too much on quantitative differences
- Neglect qualitative factors

**Conclusion on Individual Differences:**

> "A one-size-fits-all approach to choice architecture will not always work, particularly in diverse and sometimes highly politicized environments."

**Best practices:**

1. Understand which individual differences matter for your domain
2. Test interventions in diverse populations
3. Consider providing customized information when possible
4. Be particularly careful in politicized contexts
### 3.2 Evaluating Outcomes: Prediction vs. Experience

**The fundamental question:** How can we tell if a choice architecture intervention has actually helped?

**The obvious answer:** Look at whether people are happier with outcomes
**The problem:** People often cannot accurately predict how they'll feel about outcomes
#### **The Prediction-Experience Gap**

**What most choice theories assume:**

- Utility estimated EX ANTE (before experience) = Utility experienced EX POST (after experience)
- If you think you'll like something, you will
- If you think something will make you happy, it will

**Reality from research:** Numerous ways people fail to accurately predict how they'll feel about choice outcomes (Hsee & Hastie 2006; Loewenstein & Schkade 1999)
#### **Common Prediction Errors:**

##### **Error 1: Impact Bias** People OVERESTIMATE the impact of various factors on well-being

**Example - Income:**

- People overestimate how much happier they'll be with more money (Kahneman et al. 2006)
- Actual effect of income on happiness is smaller than predicted

**Example - Academic tenure:**

- Professors greatly overestimate how devastated they'll be if denied tenure
- Actual emotional impact is much smaller and shorter-lived than predicted (Gilbert et al. 1998)

**Example - Romantic breakup:**

- People greatly overestimate the duration of emotional response to breakup
- Adaptation happens faster than predicted (Gilbert et al. 1998)
##### **Error 2: Projection Bias** People UNDERESTIMATE how their current state affects their predictions

**Example - Grocery shopping:**

- Shopping while hungry leads to buying much more food
- People underestimate how empty stomach affects decisions (Nisbett & Kanouse 1968)
- Once home and full, regret the purchases
##### **Error 3: Focalism and Duration Neglect** People focus too much on one aspect and UNDERPREDICT adaptation

**The adaptation problem:** People greatly underestimate how quickly they adapt to changes, both positive and negative (Schkade & Kahneman 1998)

**Example - Major life changes:**

- Moving to California (people think they'll be much happier; adaptation makes effect small)
- Getting a promotion (people think they'll be thrilled forever; adapt quickly)
- Becoming disabled (people think life will be terrible; adapt more than expected)

##### **Error 4: Distinction Bias** Things that seem very different when evaluating side-by-side feel more similar when experienced separately

**Example:**

- Comparing two houses side by side, small differences seem huge
- Living in either house, the differences barely matter day-to-day
#### **Who Predicts Better: The Role of Experience**

**Key finding:** People WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE in a situation make MORE ACCURATE predictions about adaptation (Schkade & Kahneman 1998)

**Implications:**

- Novices need more help from choice architecture
- Experts can rely more on their own predictions
- Experienced advisors can help bridge the gap

#### **Existing Policy Responses (Already Recognize This Problem)**

Many consumer protection policies reflect tacit knowledge of prediction-experience gap:

**"Cooling Off" Periods:**

- Allow consumers to cancel choices without penalty within certain timeframe
- Recognize that people may make different decisions once emotions cool
- Examples: Door-to-door sales (3-day right of cancellation), time-share purchases (rescission periods)

**Why they exist:**

- Acknowledge that decisions made in the heat of the moment may not match experienced utility
- Give people chance to reconsider once initial emotional state passes

**Role of Experienced Agents and Advisors:**

One function advisors serve: Encourage decision-makers to consider not just:

- Features salient AT TIME OF CHOICE
- But also features important WHEN OUTCOMES ARE EXPERIENCED

**Example - Home buying:** Realtor might point out:

- "The open floor plan looks great now, but think about the noise when you have kids"
- "The long commute seems fine on Saturday, but consider doing it twice a day, every day"

#### **Implications for Choice Architecture**

**The toolbox should include interventions that bear on decision-maker's knowledge about future outcomes:**

|Problem|Intervention|How It Helps|
|---|---|---|
|**Focalism**|Direct attention to day-to-day experience, not just headline features|"Think about a typical Tuesday evening in this house"|
|**Impact bias**|Provide information about adaptation|"Most people adjust to this change within 6 months"|
|**Projection bias**|Create opportunity to experience in relevant state|Test drive car in rain, not just sunshine; shop for groceries after eating|
|**Lack of experience**|Provide data on experienced utility from others|Customer reviews focusing on long-term use, not initial impressions|

**Example Application: Major Purchase Decisions**

**Car buying architecture that accounts for prediction-experience gap:**

❌ **Traditional approach:**

- Test drive on sunny Saturday
- Focus on exciting features (acceleration, sound system)
- Compare specifications side-by-side

✅ **Better approach:**

- Extended test drive including rush hour commute
- Focus on daily use features (visibility, ease of parking, cargo space)
- Information on owner satisfaction after 1 year and 3 years
- "Cooling off" period to return vehicle

**The Bottom Line:**

> "These and other interventions that bear on the decision-maker's knowledge about their future outcomes should be considered part of the decision architect's toolkit."

**Key principle:** Don't just help people choose what they THINK they want; help them understand what they'll ACTUALLY experience

## Part 4: Real-World Applications

### 4.1 Environmental Decisions

**Domain scope includes:**

- **Energy consumption:** Appliances, transportation, heating/cooling
- **Water use:** Showers, gardening, swimming pools, rice farming
- **Land use:** Deforestation, agriculture types, urban planning

#### **Why This Domain Needs Choice Architecture**

**The climate change challenge:**

- Perhaps the greatest sustainability challenge
- Requires **drastic reductions** in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
- Needs reduced energy consumption + better efficiency + conservation

**Why it seems like a win-win:**

- Produces **financial gains for consumers** (lower energy bills)
- Produces **societal gains for environment** (reduced emissions)
- Seemingly should be easy to promote

**Why traditional economic approaches haven't worked:** Psychological biases are barriers to adoption that economic incentives alone can't overcome (Weber 2012, in press)
#### **Traditional Economic Solutions (Insufficient)**

**Approach 1: Regulate behavior**

- Building codes
- CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards
- Result: Often without substantial effects

**Approach 2: Raise price of energy**

- Carbon tax (in some countries, not USA)
- Higher energy prices
- Result: Often without substantial effects

**Why they fail:**

- Present bias: Future savings heavily discounted
- Psychological distance: Climate change feels abstract and far away
- Status quo bias: Easier to keep current behavior
- Lack of evaluability: Hard to understand impact of individual actions

#### **Behavioral Interventions That Work Better**

**Example 1: Social Comparison**
- Show households their energy use compared to neighbors
- Effect: Average 2% reduction (though varies by political affiliation)

**Example 2: Defaults**
- Opt-out for renewable energy vs. opt-in
- Dramatic differences in adoption rates

**Example 3: Translation**
- Convert energy use to dollars per year
- Show CO2 emissions as "equivalent to X trees"
- Makes abstract concrete

**Example 4: Limited time windows**
- Tax credits for energy-efficient appliances with expiration dates
- Creates urgency that overcomes procrastination

### 4.2 Financial Decisions

**Why financial decisions are prime for choice architecture:**

- Complex products (retirement plans, mortgages, credit cards)
- Intertemporal tradeoffs (present sacrifice for future benefit)
- Present bias is strong
- Low financial literacy
- High stakes (mistakes are costly)

### 4.3 Eating Decisions

**Why eating behavior is special:**

- People make 200-300 food decisions per day (Wansink & Sobal 2007)
- Most occur without conscious thought
- People rely on heuristics and decision rules (Wansink 2010)
- Habitual behaviors become rigid and unresponsive to changes in health/nutrition understanding

#### **Evidence of Non-Economic Behavior**

**Example: Pizza Buffet Study** (Just & Wansink 2011)

**Setup:** All-you-can-eat pizza buffet with different prices

**What economics predicts:**

- People should eat the same amount regardless of price (it's all-you-can-eat!)
- Sunk cost doesn't matter

**What actually happened:**

- Doubling the price led people to eat MORE pizza
- Even though diminishing returns to taste and perceived quality quickly dropped
- Led them to eat more AND enjoy it less

**Interpretation:** "I paid more, so I should eat more" → irrational but real

#### **Traditional Interventions That FAIL in Eating**

**Approach 1: Alter prices**

- Taxing unhealthy food
- Subsidizing healthy food
- Result: Generally ineffective (Mytton et al. 2007)

**Approach 2: Provide information**

- Nutrition labels
- Calorie counts on menus
- Result: Generally ineffective in altering consumption

**Why they fail:**

- Decisions are mindless/habitual
- Made hundreds of times per day
- Cognitive capacity overwhelmed
- Present enjoyment > future health

#### **Behavioral Interventions That Work**

**Intervention 1: Partitioning**

- Separate shopping cart sections for fruits/vegetables
- Segregate healthy menu items into separate categories
- Result: Purchases/choices match partition structure (Wansink et al. 2012)

**Intervention 2: Defaults**

- Make healthy option the default side dish
- Require active choice to substitute unhealthy option
- Result: Significant increase in healthy choices

**Intervention 3: Portion size/Packaging**

- Smaller plates in cafeterias
- 100-calorie snack packs
- Result: People eat less without feeling deprived

**Intervention 4: Convenience**

- Place healthy foods at eye level
- Make unhealthy foods less convenient
- Result: Significant shifts in consumption

**Intervention 5: "Trigger foods"**

- Control what foods are available together
- Presence of bananas and green beans → decreased ice cream sales
- Presence of sugary sides → increased cake and chips sales
- (Hanks et al. 2012)

#### **Key Insight: Modified Utility Theory**

**Standard economic model:** Assumes rational time and risk preferences

**Reality:** Need to modify standard utility theory to allow for:

- Psychological processes
- Effects in combination with economic incentives
- (Just & Wansink 2009)

## Synthesis: Why Behavioral Economics Works Where Economics Fails

### The Limits of Traditional Economic Solutions

**Traditional economic policy levers:**

1. **Alter prices** (taxes, subsidies)
2. **Provide information** (labels, disclosure requirements)
3. **Restrict behavior** (bans, mandates)

### **Why These Often Fail:**

**Financial decisions:**

- Purely economic incentives not enough
- Even company matching on 401(k) contributions doesn't achieve 100% participation
- Present bias too strong

**Food consumption:**

- Behavior can't be reconciled with standard economic models
- Altering prices generally ineffective
- Information generally ineffective

**Environmental choices:**

- Regulating behavior (building codes, CAFE standards) often without substantial effects
- Raising energy prices (carbon tax) often without substantial effects

### **The Issues Traditional Economics Doesn't Address:**

1. **Excessive discounting** - Future benefits heavily discounted
2. **Status quo effects** - Strong preference for current state
3. **Information processing limitations** - Can't handle complexity
4. **Present bias** - Strong preference for immediate outcomes
5. **Framing effects** - How options are described matters enormously
6. **Choice overload** - Too many options reduces decision quality
7. **Naive allocation** - Tendency to allocate evenly across categories
8. **Prediction-experience gap** - What we think we'll like ≠ what we actually like

### **Why Behavioral Interventions Work:**

**Key principle:** Behavioral economics offers means to encourage more optimal behavior WITHOUT inducing resistance and reactance often associated with restrictive policies (Just & Wansink 2009)

**Acceptance by the public:**

- Such behavioral interventions are not necessarily objectionable to decision-makers
- Even when unaware of impacts on their own behavior (Johnson & Goldstein 2003; Wansink 2012)
- Individuals believe they're better off
- Intervention encourages good behavior while NOT PROHIBITING bad behavior

## Additional Situational Factors

Beyond the main tools, many subtle situational changes can have desirable effects:

|Factor|Effect|Research|
|---|---|---|
|**Website wallpaper**|Changes what people buy|Mandel & Johnson 2002|
|**Social setting**|Affects choices|Milch et al. 2009|
|**Information mode**|Text vs. visual affects decisions|Weber & Lindemann 2007|
|**Framing of outcomes**|Gains vs. losses dramatically affects choice|Tversky & Kahneman 1981|
|**Attribute labels**|Word choice changes preference|Hardisty et al. 2010|

## Ethical Considerations and Transparency

### The Manipulation Concern

**Objection:** "Choice architects influence behavior without decision-makers' awareness—isn't this manipulation?"
### **Response 1: Full Disclosure**

**Proposal:** Choice formats could be accompanied by description of potential influences

**What this means:**

- Explain how the choice is structured
- Describe known effects of that structure
- Example: "This form uses defaults. Research shows defaults increase selection rates by 40%."

**Current state:**

- Such full disclosure rarely done today
- Effects deserve further study

**Goal:** Making open disclosure a routine responsibility for choice architects

### **Response 2: No Neutral Alternative**

**Key point:** There IS NO neutral presentation

- Every choice architecture influences outcomes
- The question isn't "Should we influence?" but "How should we structure influence?"
- Even "random" presentation is a choice that has effects

### **Response 3: Preserves Freedom**

**Libertarian paternalism:**

- Nudges people toward better choices
- While preserving freedom to choose otherwise
- Contrasts with bans or mandates

**Example - Organ donation:**

- Opt-out default increases donation rates
- But anyone can still opt out
- Freedom preserved, outcomes improved

### **Response 4: Benefits Decision-Makers**

**Public acceptance:**

- People don't object to nudges when they benefit profit-seeking sellers
- Should be even MORE willing when nudges benefit themselves or society
- Examples: Health, environment, financial security
