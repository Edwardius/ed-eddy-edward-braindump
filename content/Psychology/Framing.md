# **Framing Effects in Political Communication**

## **What Is a Frame?**

A **frame** is a way of presenting or interpreting information that emphasizes certain aspects while downplaying others, which shapes how people understand and evaluate an issue.

---

## **The Expectancy-Value Model (Foundation)**

People form political opinions by:

1. **Evaluating expected outcomes** of a policy
2. **Weighing how much they care** about those outcomes

**Example**: Someone might understand environmental risks but still not support climate policy if they don't personally care about environmental issues.

### **Limitations of This Model:**

- Most people **don't have well-formed opinions** on political issues
- They have **few organized thoughts** about complex policies
- This creates opportunities for framing to shape opinion

---

## **Three Related but Distinct Concepts**

|Concept|Mechanism|What Changes|
|---|---|---|
|**Framing**|Affects the **weight** of considerations|How much you care about certain aspects|
|**Priming**|Increases **accessibility** of thoughts|What comes to mind when thinking about an issue|
|**Persuasion**|Changes the **evaluation** itself|Your actual opinion on the matter|

**Example**:

- **Framing**: "Climate policy" framed as "green jobs" makes economic benefits more important to you
- **Priming**: Mentioning crime before asking about immigration makes you think about safety
- **Persuasion**: Providing evidence that changes your mind about whether policy X works

---

## **Two Perspectives on Frames**

### **1. Frame in Mind (Cognitive)**

- Mental structures people use to organize and interpret information
- Like a lens through which you view issues
- Can be activated by communication

### **2. Frame in Communication (Strategic)**

- How elites (media, politicians) present information
- **Purpose**: Give meaning to unfolding events and shape how people interpret facts
- **Key insight**: The same facts can be presented very differently

---

## **How to Study Framing (Research Process)**

Researchers face challenges because there's **no single "correct" method**. The typical approach:

1. **Identify the issue or event**
    - Frames exist in relation to specific topics (healthcare, immigration, etc.)
2. **Isolate a specific attitude**
    - What opinion are you measuring? (support for policy, candidate evaluation, etc.)
3. **Identify initial frames**
    - Gather frames from previous research, media analysis, or pilot studies
    - Look at how the issue is actually being discussed in public
4. **Select sources**
    - Where will you look for frames? (news media, political speeches, social media)
    - Who is doing the framing? (politicians, journalists, activists)

---

## **How Strong Are Framing Effects?**

**Short answer**: Hard to say definitively—**it depends on context**.

### **Three Approaches to Measuring Strength:**

1. **Compare across frames**
    - Show people different frames of the same issue
    - Measure how much opinions shift between frames
    - **Challenge**: Difficult to know if frames are equally strong
2. **Compare framed preferences to personal values**
    - Do frames lead people to opinions that align with their core values?
    - Or do frames override values temporarily?
    - **Insight**: Strong frames can make people support policies that contradict their values
3. **Compare treatment groups to control group**
    - Show some people a frame, others no frame
    - **Challenge**: Nearly impossible to create a "frameless" control in real politics
    - Everything is framed somehow

## **How Framing Effects Work (Mechanisms)**

Frames influence opinion through three pathways:

### **1. Creating New Beliefs**

- Introduces considerations people hadn't thought about
- **Example**: Framing healthcare as "freedom to choose doctors" creates new belief about autonomy

### **2. Making Certain Beliefs More Accessible**

- Brings existing beliefs to the front of people's minds
- **Example**: Mentioning "tax burden" makes cost considerations more salient

### **3. Making Existing Beliefs Stronger**

- Reinforces beliefs people already held weakly
- **Example**: Repeated "tough on crime" framing strengthens law-and-order attitudes

### **Mediation Question:**

Do framing effects require people to have **pre-existing beliefs** to work with?

- **Generally yes**: Frames connect to values and beliefs people already have
- But frames can also introduce entirely new considerations

---

## **When Do People Consciously Evaluate Frames?**

Most of the time, frames work **automatically** without conscious thought. But people evaluate frames more carefully when:

### **1. They're Motivated**

- High personal relevance
- Strong prior interest in the issue
- Consequences matter to them

### **2. Opposing Frames Are Present**

- **Key insight**: Exposure to competing frames increases motivation to think carefully
- Forces people to **deliberate and reconcile** different interpretations
- **Result**: Less susceptible to any single frame

**Example**: If you only hear "tax relief," you accept it. If you hear both "tax relief" and "tax cuts for the wealthy," you think more critically about both.

---

## **What Makes Framing Effects Stronger or Weaker? (Moderators)**

### **1. Predispositions and Values**

- **Strong prior beliefs** = more resistant to framing
- **Weak or ambivalent beliefs** = more susceptible to framing
- People with strong partisan identity harder to sway

### **2. Intelligence and Knowledge** (Paradoxical Effect!)

This is counterintuitive:

|Knowledge Level|Susceptibility|Why?|
|---|---|---|
|**Low knowledge**|High susceptibility|Lack information to resist frames|
|**Moderate knowledge**|Lower susceptibility|Enough info to be somewhat critical|
|**High knowledge**|High susceptibility|Sophisticated enough to rationalize frame's logic|

**The paradox**: Very knowledgeable people can be persuaded by sophisticated frames because they understand the arguments better and can integrate them into complex reasoning.

---

## **Two Main Types of Frames**

### **1. Equivalency Frames (Valence Framing)**

Present **logically equivalent information** in positive vs. negative terms

**Classic examples:**

- "90% survival rate" vs. "10% mortality rate"
- "Glass half full" vs. "Glass half empty"
- "Tax relief" vs. "Revenue loss"

**Effect**: Changes emotional response even though facts are identical

### **2. Emphasis Frames (Issue Framing)**

Highlight **different aspects** of a multifaceted issue

**Examples:**

|Issue|Frame A|Frame B|
|---|---|---|
|Immigration|Economic contribution|Cultural integration challenges|
|Free speech|Democratic principle|Potential for harm|
|Climate policy|Green jobs|Economic costs|

**Effect**: Makes certain considerations more important in people's judgments

---

## **What Makes a Frame Strong?**

A **strong frame**:

- Connects the proposal to **widely shared positive values or goals**
- Resonates with cultural beliefs
- Simple and memorable
- Emotionally compelling

**Examples of strong frames:**

- "Freedom" (connects to American values)
- "Protecting our children" (universal parental concern)
- "Fairness" (widely shared principle)

### **Critical Caveat: Context-Dependency**

- A frame that works in one context may fail in another
- Geographic differences (urban vs. rural)
- Temporal differences (peacetime vs. wartime)
- Audience differences (liberals vs. conservatives)

**Example**: "Individual freedom" frame works well with conservatives but may be less effective with liberals who value collective responsibility.

---

## **How Do Frames Originate?**

**Honest answer**: We don't fully understand frame formation.

### **Entman's Cascade Model** (Best Theory We Have)

Frames flow through society in a hierarchical cascade:

```
Administration/Political Elites
         ↓
    News Media
         ↓
      Public
```

**How it works:**

1. **Political elites** (presidents, party leaders) introduce frames strategically
2. **Media** adopts, adapts, or challenges these frames
3. **Public** receives and potentially accepts frames

**Strategic motivation:**

- Politicians frame issues to make their positions sound better
- They **exploit cognitive heuristics** (mental shortcuts):
    - Availability heuristic (what comes to mind easily)
    - Representativeness heuristic (stereotypes)
    - Loss aversion (fear of losses > desire for gains)

**Example of cascade:**

- President frames policy as "protecting American jobs"
- Media headlines use "job protection" language
- Public discussion centers on employment rather than other aspects

**Complications:**

- Social media disrupts traditional cascade
- Multiple competing elites create frame contests
- Media doesn't always passively transmit frames
