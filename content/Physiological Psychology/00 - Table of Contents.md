# Psychology and the Mind - Index

## Overview
This collection covers the biological foundations of psychology, exploring how the brain produces behavior, cognition, and consciousness. The content is organized into logical topics progressing from historical foundations through cellular mechanisms to complex brain structures.

## Topic Structure

### 1. [Historical Foundations and Mind-Body Theories](./Historical%20Foundations%20and%20Mind-Body%20Theories.md)
**Core concepts:** Philosophy of mind, early scientific approaches
- Ancient theories (Hippocrates vs Aristotle)
- Dualism vs Monism debate
- Descartes' mind-body dualism
- Phrenology and localization of function
- Modern consciousness theories (Chalmers' hard problem)

### 2. [Language and Brain Lateralization](./Language%20and%20Brain%20Lateralization.md)
**Core concepts:** Language processing, hemispheric specialization
- Brain language areas (Broca's, Wernicke's)
- Split brain studies and commissurotomy
- Hemispatial neglect and perceptual disorders
- Corpus callosum function

### 3. [Neurons and Neural Cells](./Neurons%20and%20Neural%20Cells.md)
**Core concepts:** Cellular basis of nervous system
- Neuron doctrine and cell types
- Neuronal structure and function
- Glial cells and their roles
- Blood-brain barrier
- Synaptic organization

### 4. [Action Potentials and Neural Conduction](./Action%20Potentials%20and%20Neural%20Conduction.md)
**Core concepts:** Electrical signaling in neurons
- Historical discoveries (Galvani, Hodgkin & Huxley)
- Action potential phases and mechanisms
- Saltatory conduction and myelination
- Multiple sclerosis as conduction disorder

### 5. [Synaptic Transmission and Neurotransmitters](./Synaptic%20Transmission%20and%20Neurotransmitters.md)
**Core concepts:** Chemical communication between neurons
- Neurotransmitter categories and synthesis
- Synaptic transmission process
- Receptor types (ionotropic vs metabotropic)
- Tripartite synapse concept
- Signal termination mechanisms

### 6. [Drugs and Pharmacology](./Drugs%20and%20Pharmacology.md)
**Core concepts:** How substances affect neural function
- Mechanisms of drug action at synapses
- Specific drugs (caffeine, alcohol, opioids, etc.)
- Addiction and reward pathways
- Tolerance and withdrawal
- Brain changes in addiction

### 7. [Spinal Cord and Peripheral Nervous System](./Spinal%20Cord%20and%20Peripheral%20Nervous%20System.md)
**Core concepts:** Basic neuroanatomy and organization
- Anatomical directions and planes
- Spinal cord structure and reflexes
- Cranial nerves
- Autonomic nervous system divisions
- Protective structures (meninges, CSF)

### 8. [Brainstem and Midbrain](./Brainstem%20and%20Midbrain.md)
**Core concepts:** Basic life functions and arousal
- Medulla (breathing, cardiovascular control)
- Pons (sleep-wake, arousal)
- Cerebellum (motor coordination, cognition)
- Midbrain structures (dopamine systems, sensory orienting)

### 9. [Forebrain and Cortical Structure](./Forebrain%20and%20Cortical%20Structure.md)
**Core concepts:** Higher-order brain functions
- Thalamus as relay center
