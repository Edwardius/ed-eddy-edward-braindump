# **Synaptic Transmission and Neurotransmitters**

## **The Synapse**
- Communication point between neurons.
- **Presynaptic terminal** releases neurotransmitters.
- **Postsynaptic dendritic spine** receives them via receptors.

## **The Tripartite Synapse**
- Classical view: communication is between **presynaptic axon terminal** and **postsynaptic dendritic spine**.
- Updated view: **astrocytes** also play an active role.
    - They take up neurotransmitters, release **gliotransmitters**, and help regulate ionic balance (K⁺, Ca²⁺).
    - This creates a _tripartite_ synapse: neuron–neuron–astrocyte.
- Important note: **glutamate**, though the main excitatory neurotransmitter, can be toxic in excess → leads to **excitotoxicity** and neuronal death.

## **Neurotransmitters**
Organized into several categories:
### **Amines**
- **Catecholamines**: derived from _phenylalanine → tyrosine → dopa → dopamine → norepinephrine → epinephrine_.
  - Dopamine pathways originate in [[Brainstem and Midbrain|midbrain structures]] (VTA, substantia nigra)
- **Indolamines**: from _tryptophan → 5-HTP → serotonin → N-acetylserotonin → melatonin_.
  - Serotonin neurons concentrated in [[Brainstem and Midbrain|brainstem raphe nuclei]]
- **Acetylcholine**: from _choline + acetyl CoA_.
  - Key in [[Forebrain and Cortical Structure#Basal Ganglia|basal ganglia]] and motor control
### **Amino Acids**
- **Glutamate** – major excitatory transmitter.
- **GABA** – major inhibitory transmitter.
- **Glycine** – another inhibitory transmitter.
### **Peptides**
- e.g., Enkephalins, Substance P, Insulin, Oxytocin.
### **Gases**
- e.g., Nitric oxide (NO), Carbon monoxide (CO).
### **Other Small Molecules**
- e.g., ATP, Adenosine.

## **Neurotransmitter Release**
Steps:
1. **Neurotransmitter synthesis**
    - Small molecules synthesized in the terminal.
    - **Neuropeptides** synthesized in the soma and shipped down via **fast axonal transport**.
2. **Vesicle loading** – neurotransmitters stored in vesicles
3. **Docking and priming** – vesicles attach to the membrane via **SNARE proteins**.
4. **Action potential arrival** → depolarizes terminal.
5. **Voltage-gated calcium channels** open; Ca²⁺ enters.
6. **Exocytosis** – vesicles fuse and release neurotransmitters.
7. **Vesicle recycling** – endocytosis retrieves vesicle membranes for reuse.

**Vesicle Pools**:
- **Readily Releasable Pool** (<1%) – docked and ready.
- **Recycling Pool** (5–20%) – quickly mobilized.
- **Reserve Pool** (80–90%) – held in storage.

## **Postsynaptic Activity**
### **Ligand-Gated Ion Channels**
- Neurotransmitters bind to receptors → ion channels open.
- Effects depend on ions:
    - **EPSP (Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential)** – depolarization, brings neuron closer to threshold (e.g., Na⁺ influx).
    - **IPSP (Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential)** – hyperpolarization, moves neuron further from threshold (e.g., Cl⁻ influx or K⁺ efflux).
### **Summation**
- **Temporal Summation**: repeated stimulation over time adds up.
- **Spatial Summation**: simultaneous inputs from multiple presynaptic neurons combine.

## **Types of Synaptic Receptors**
### **Ionotropic Receptors**
- Direct binding site on ion channel.
- Fast, short-lived (e.g., nicotinic ACh receptor, GABA(A), AMPA glutamate receptor).
### **Metabotropic Receptors**
- Work through **G-proteins**, indirectly influencing ion channels.
- Slower, longer-lasting effects (seconds to minutes).
- Examples: muscarinic ACh receptor, GABA(B), serotonin (5-HT(1A)).

## **Neurotransmitter Effects**
- One neurotransmitter can act on multiple receptor types:
    - **Acetylcholine**: nicotinic (ionotropic), muscarinic (metabotropic).
    - **GABA**: GABA(A) (ionotropic, Cl⁻ channel), GABA(B) (metabotropic, K⁺ channel).
    - **Glutamate**: AMPA (ionotropic, Na⁺), NMDA (ionotropic, Na⁺ & Ca²⁺), metabotropic.

## **Termination of Neurotransmitter Effects**
1. **Reuptake** – neurotransmitter taken back into presynaptic terminal via transporters.
2. **Enzymatic breakdown** – e.g., acetylcholinesterase, COMT.
3. **Diffusion** – neurotransmitter drifts away.
4. **Autoreceptors** – presynaptic receptors that inhibit further release.
5. **Retrograde transmission** – postsynaptic cell releases signals that influence presynaptic release.

## **Types of Synapses**
- Classified by the location of contact:
    - **Axodendritic**: axon → dendrite.
    - **Axo-somatic**: axon → soma.
    - **Axo-axonic**: axon → axon (often modulatory).

## **The War of the Soups and Sparks**
- Early 20th century debate:
    - **"Sparks" (neurophysiologists)** – believed transmission was **electrical**, based on direct measurements of neuron activity.
    - **"Soups" (pharmacologists)** – believed it was **chemical**, supported by effects of drugs and toxins (e.g., curare blocking ACh).
- Resolution: both were partly correct.
    - Most synapses are **chemical**, but **electrical synapses** exist too.
- Nobel Prizes:
    - Henry Dale & Otto Loewi (1936) → discovery of chemical neurotransmission.
    - John Eccles (1963) → synaptic physiology.

## **Electrical vs. Chemical Synapses**
### **Electrical Synapses (Gap Junctions)**
- Direct physical connections between cells via **connexons**.
- Allow passage of ions and small molecules directly between cytoplasms.
- Very fast, synchronous communication.
- Found widely across brain regions, often in interneurons.
### **Chemical Synapses**
- Neurotransmitters cross a cleft and bind to receptors.
- Slower but more flexible and modifiable.
### **Mixed Synapses**
- Some synapses combine both electrical and chemical transmission.
- Example: hippocampus synapses with **connexin-36** gap junctions coupled with glutamatergic transmission.

## **Neuropeptides**
- Examples: Enkephalins, Substance P, Oxytocin, Insulin.
- Key features:
    - Synthesized in the soma (not terminal).
    - Often released from dendrites, soma, or axon sides—not just terminals.
    - Long half-life (~20 minutes; contrast with ms for classical transmitters).
    - Spread to distant targets.
    - Functions: modify synapses, alter gene expression, regulate glia.

## **Gaseous Neurotransmitters**
- **Nitric oxide (NO)** is a key example.
- Small, membrane-permeable → diffuses freely across membranes.
- Can act retrogradely (postsynaptic → presynaptic).
- Regulates synaptic strength, vascular tone, and plasticity.

## **Co-Transmission**
- A single neuron can release multiple types of neurotransmitters.
- Example: one cell might release both a small-molecule transmitter (e.g., glutamate) and a peptide (e.g., substance P).

## **Neural Circuit Properties**
- **Convergence**: multiple presynaptic neurons synapse onto one postsynaptic neuron.
- **Divergence**: one presynaptic neuron sends output to multiple postsynaptic neurons.
