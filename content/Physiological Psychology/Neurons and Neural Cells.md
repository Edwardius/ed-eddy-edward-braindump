# **Cells of the Nervous System**
## **The Neuron Doctrine**
- Competing 19th-century views:
    - **Reticular Theory (Josef von Gerlach, Camillo Golgi)**: nervous system is a _continuous network_.
    - **Neuron Theory (Ramón y Cajal)**: nervous system is composed of _individual, autonomous cells_ ("contiguity, not continuity").
- Cajal's drawings confirmed neurons are distinct units — this is the **Neuron Doctrine**, foundation of neuroscience.
## **Types of Cells in the Brain**
- Whole brain: ~170 billion cells    
    - **Neurons**: ~86 billion (making up the **Grey Matter**)
    - **Glia**: ~84 billion (making up the **While Matter**)
- Ratios vary by region:
    - **Cerebral cortex**: ~16B neurons : 61B glia (~1:3.75)
    - **Cerebellum**: ~69B neurons : 16B glia (~4.3:1)
    - **Rest of brain**: ~0.7B neurons : 7.7B glia (~1:11)

## **The Neuron**
- **Main parts**: Soma (cell body), dendrites, axon, axon terminals.
- Function relates to shape:
    - **Multipolar neuron** – many dendrites, most common in CNS.
    - **Bipolar neuron** – one dendrite, one axon (e.g., retina).
    - **Unipolar neuron** – single process (e.g., sensory neurons).

- **Inside the soma**: nucleus, ER, ribosomes, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, etc.
- Dendrites: receive input, covered in **spines** (plastic, motile, change shape in seconds).
	- **Actin** act as the skeleton of the cell, help with shifting the shape of the dendrites.
- Axon: conducts signals, insulated by **myelin** with gaps called **Nodes of Ranvier**.
	- At the base of the Axon connecting to the Soma is the **Axon Hillock** which integrates incoming signals from the dendrites and determining whether to trigger an [[Action Potentials and Neural Conduction]]

## **Axonal Transport**
- Microtubules serve as "tracks."
- **Kinesin**: moves cargo _anterograde_ (from soma → axon terminal).
- **Dynein**: moves cargo _retrograde_ (axon terminal → soma).
- Ensures neurotransmitters, vesicles, and proteins reach where they're needed.

## **The Synapse**
- Coined by **Charles Sherrington (1906)**: neurons are not continuous but communicate at junctions.
- **Presynaptic terminal** releases **neurotransmitters**.
- **Postsynaptic dendrite** receives them via **receptors**.
- This chemical communication allows flexibility and modulation of signals.

**Key distinction**
- **Efferent axons**: carry signals _away_ from a region.
- **Afferent axons**: carry signals _toward_ a region.
## **Glia**
Not just "support cells" — glia have crucial active roles.

### **Astrocytes**
- Form part of the **blood-brain barrier** (BBB).
    - Tight junctions in capillaries restrict entry of molecules.
    - Only lipid-soluble substances (e.g., CO₂, fats) can diffuse freely.
    - Larger molecules (e.g., glucose, amino acids, insulin) need active transport.
- Regulate blood flow: dilate/constrict vessels.
- Provide nutrients to neurons.
- Connect with other astrocytes for molecule transfer.
- Create scaffolding that organizes neurons.
- **Tripartite synapse**: astrocytes wrap around synapses, modulate neurotransmission, and synchronize activity across multiple synapses.

### **Schwann Cells**
- Found in the **peripheral nervous system (PNS)**.
- Each Schwann cell wraps a **single segment of one axon** with myelin.
- Create **nodes of Ranvier** between myelinated sections, allowing saltatory conduction.

### **Oligodendrocytes**
- Found in the **central nervous system (CNS)**.
- Unlike Schwann cells, one oligodendrocyte can myelinate **multiple axons**.
- Provide faster, more efficient conduction across the CNS.

### **Polydendrocytes (NG2 cells)**
- Also called **oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs)**.
- Functions:
    - Can remyelinate axons after injury.
    - Act as precursors to new oligodendrocytes.
    - Can even **form synapses with neurons**.
- Their processes cross multiple layers, meaning they may integrate information across grey and white matter.

### **Microglia**
- The **immune cells of the CNS**.
- Functions:
    - Remove damaged or dead cells (including glioma tumor cells, precursors, stressed neurons, immune cells like neutrophils).
    - In development, prune unnecessary synapses and neuronal precursors.
    - Even in adulthood, help reshape synaptic connections ("synaptic stripping").

### **Radial Glia**
- Act as **scaffolds during development**.
- Guide migrating neurons from the ventricular zone to the cortex.
- Later in development, many differentiate into neurons or astrocytes.
