# **Action Potentials and Neural Conduction**

## **Historical Background: The Action Potential**
- **Psychic Pneuma** (Herophilus & Galen, ~200 BCE):
    - Nerves carried an invisible "air-like" substance responsible for perception and action.
    - Thought to flow from brain ventricles into nerves.
- **Luigi Galvani (1737–1798)**:
    - Demonstrated that **nerves conduct electrical signals**.
    - Famous frog-leg experiments with static electricity.
- **Johannes Müller (1801–1858)**:
    - Law of Specific Nerve Energies: different nerves carry specific types of information (optic nerve → vision, auditory nerve → sound).
    - Experience is determined by the **pathway**, not the stimulus.
- **Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894)**:
    - Measured **speed of nerve conduction**.
    - Developed the ophthalmoscope, color vision theory, and audition theory.
## **The Action Potential**

### Basics
- Begins at the **axon hillock**.
- Travels down axon **without decreasing in size** (non-decremental).
- Is an **all-or-none electrical event**.
### Hodgkin & Huxley (1940s)
- Used the **squid giant axon** to measure membrane potentials.
- Found:
    - At rest: inside = negative (~–70 mV).
    - Depolarization beyond a **threshold (~–65 mV)** triggers an action potential.
### Phases of the Action Potential
1. **Resting Potential** – K⁺ channels partly open; Na⁺ channels closed.
2. **Depolarization** – Na⁺ channels open rapidly, Na⁺ floods in. (See [[Drugs and Pharmacology]] for how drugs block these channels)
3. **Rising Phase (Upstroke)** – rapid influx of Na⁺.
4. **Falling Phase (Downstroke)** – Na⁺ channels close; K⁺ channels fully open, K⁺ exits.
5. **Afterhyperpolarization** – K⁺ continues leaving, cell becomes more negative than resting.
6. **Return to Resting** – sodium-potassium pump restores gradients (3 Na⁺ out, 2 K⁺ in).
### Ion Forces
- **Diffusion**: ions move down concentration gradients.
- **Electrostatic force**: opposite charges attract, like charges repel.
### Refractory Periods
- **Absolute refractory period**: no new action potential possible (Na⁺ channels inactive).
- **Relative refractory period**: requires stronger stimulation (membrane hyperpolarized).
### All-or-None Law
- Action potential magnitude is the same, regardless of stimulus strength.
- Stronger stimulus only increases **firing frequency**, not spike size.

## **Propagation of the Action Potential**
- Moves actively along axon by sequential depolarization of adjacent regions.
- **Saltatory conduction**: in myelinated axons, AP "jumps" between nodes of Ranvier → faster and more efficient.
- **Passive Conduction**: in unmyelinated axons, slower
## **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
- An **autoimmune disorder** where the body attacks **myelin**.
- Results in slower or blocked conduction of nerve impulses.
- Symptoms:
    - Muscle weakness
    - Sensory problems
    - Cognitive deficits
- Course:
    - Stage 1: intermittent symptoms.
    - Stage 2: progressively worsening.
### Genetic Risk
- Higher prevalence among people of **European ancestry**.
- Numerous genetic variants linked to MS susceptibility.
- Recent research: risk increased in **steppe pastoralist populations** (historical genetic emergence).

## **Multiple Sclerosis Mechanism**
- **MS is an autoimmune disease**: the immune system attacks **myelin**.
- **Genetic factors**: More common in people of European ancestry; many genetic variants involved.
- **Mechanism**:
    - Leaky blood-brain barrier allows **lymphocytes** into the brain.
    - These, along with microglia, release inflammatory substances.
    - Myelin segments break down → disrupts **saltatory conduction**.
    - Downstream of the demyelinated region, the axon withers away and an **axonal ovoid** is formed
- **Gut-brain connection**: Dysbiosis (imbalanced microbiome) weakens intestinal wall, allowing microbial products to enter bloodstream → increases inflammation and BBB leakage.
