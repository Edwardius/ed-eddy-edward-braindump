# Basic Bayes' Theorem
Also known as Bayes' rule or Bayes' law  is a result in probability theory that relates conditional probabilities. 

$$
P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

where:
- $P(A|B)$
	- is the conditional probability of A, given B. Also known as a **posterior probability**
- $P(A)$
	- is the probability of A. Also known as **prior probability** or **marginal probability** given that it doesn't take into account any information about B
- $P(B|A)$
	- is the conditional probability of B, given A.
- $P(B)$ 
	- is the probability of B. Also known as **prior probability** of B. **It acts as a normalizing constant.**
