# Welcome to My Brain Dump

This is my personal digital garden where I capture thoughts, ideas, and notes on anything that sparks my curiosity.

## What is this place?

This brain dump serves as my external memory—a place where I can:

- **Document Learning**: Notes from courses, books, articles, and videos
- **Explore Ideas**: Thoughts on technology, design, philosophy, and more  
- **Track Projects**: Development logs, experiments, and side projects
- **Connect Concepts**: Links between different areas of knowledge

## How to Navigate

Feel free to explore using:

- The **search bar** to find specific topics
- The **explorer** on the left to browse folders
- The **graph view** to see connections between notes
- **Tags** to find related content

## A Living Document

This space is constantly evolving. Notes may be incomplete, ideas might be half-formed, and thoughts could change over time. That's the beauty of a brain dump—it's a work in progress, just like learning itself.
