Having dealt with the introduction of control systems already (I should really dump my knowledge on that sometime [[Control Systems]]), its time to dive into designing control systems for the modern age. Enter Digital Control Systems. 

They have their advantages (see [[Digital vs Analog Control Systems]]), and is the most common form of controllers nowadays.

Note that the only thing "Digital" here is the controller itself, not the plant.
