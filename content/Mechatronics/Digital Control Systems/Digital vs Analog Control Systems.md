A lot of modern control systems are digital because its cheaper and easier to configure.

# Analog Controllers
### Pros
- Infinite resolution (always working in continuous time)
- No computational delays
- Allows for exact realization of controller
### Cons
- Fixed control design
- Hardware requires maintenance
- Hardware can become obselete

# Digital Controllers
### Pros
- Variable control design
- Complex controllers possible and cheap
- No nonlinearities due to physics
- More reliable
### Cons
- Sampling/computational issues 
- Potentially more complex to analyze/design
- Works in discrete time
