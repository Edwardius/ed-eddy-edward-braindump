Good question, roboting is hard. Robots don't work most of the time. But deep down, I like the anticipation, the dreaminess, the idea that if I contribute to this space enough, that one day robots will be part of our everyday lives, just like in Wall-E.

Nothing comes easy, that's just the way of the universe. Why else would part of our brain be built to handle grit?

The #brain... if anything the brain is what I am most interested in. The universe is filled with physical phenomena: supernovas, black holes, galaxies, you name it. But with the brain, you get pain, fear, happiness, love, expression, a set of meta-physical phenomena that give this universe life. Someday, maybe we'll be able to wield that meta-physical power ourselves.
