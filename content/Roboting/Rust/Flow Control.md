## if/else
main thing to note here is that boolean expression not wrapped in parentheses
```rust
fn main() {
	let big_n = 
		if n< 10 && n > -10 {
			10 * n
		} else {
			n / 2
		}; // <--- semicolon here is for let binding
}
```

## Loop
loop keyword indicates an **infinite loop**. 

```rust
fn main() {
	let mut count = 0u32;
	loop {
		count += 1;
		
		if count == 2 {
			continue; // will continue to next loop, skipping the check of count == 3
		}
		if count == 3 {
			break;
		}
	}
}
```

### Nesting and Labels
you can label the loops so that you can break and continue a specific loop
```rust
fn main() {
	'outer: loop {
		'inner: loop {
			break 'outer; // this will break the whole thing
		}
	}
}
```

### Returning from Loops
`break` keyword can actually return values
```rust
fn main() {
	let mut count = 0;
	
	let result = loop {
		count += 1;
		
		if count == 3 {
			break count * 10;
		}
	};
	
	// result will be 30
}
```

## While
loops until a condition is met
```rust
fn main() {
	let mut count = 0;
	
	while count < 10 {
		count += 1;
	}
}
```

## For and Range
defined as `for <something> in <Iterator>`, where an iterator is something you create. The easiest way it by defining a range use `..`

```rust
fn main() {
	for n in 1..100 {
		println!("{}", n);
	}
}
```

### specific iterators
There are a number of ways to iterate over lists, each with varying degrees of permissions. More in [[Traits]]

```rust
fn main() {
	let names = vec!["bob", "francis", "ferris"];
	
	// iter borrows each element, cannot mut
	for name in names.iter() {
        match name {
            &"Ferris" => println!("There is a rustacean among us!"),
            _ => println!("Hello {}", name),
        }
	}
	
	// into_iter consumes the collection, meaning it is no longer available for reuse after it has been moved into the loop
    for name in names.into_iter() {
        match name {
            "Ferris" => println!("There is a rustacean among us!"),
            _ => println!("Hello {}", name),
        }
    }

    println!("names: {:?}", names); // <-- not possible
    
    // must rebind
 	let names = vec!["bob", "francis", "ferris"];
 	// iter_mut mutably borrows each element of the collection, allowing for inplace modifications
    for name in names.iter_mut() {
        *name = match name {
            &mut "Ferris" => "There is a rustacean among us!",
            _ => "Hello",
        }
    }

    println!("names: {:?}", names); 	
}
```

## Match
provides pattern matching via `match`, similar to switch case in C
```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 13;
    // TODO ^ Try different values for `number`

    println!("Tell me about {}", number);
    match number {
        // Match a single value
        1 => println!("One!"),
        // Match several values
        2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 11 => println!("This is a prime"),
        // Match an inclusive range
        13..=19 => println!("A teen"),
        // Handle the rest of cases
        _ => println!("Ain't special"),
    }

    let boolean = true;
    // Match is an expression too
    let binary = match boolean {
        // The arms of a match must cover all the possible values
        false => 0,
        true => 1,
    };

    println!("{} -> {}", boolean, binary);
}
```

Its alot more powerful though since the cases can be expressed in various creative ways:
- They can destructure tuples, arrays, enums, pointers, and structs
- They can have further conditional guards
- They can be bound

### Destructuring
```rust
fn main() {
	// tuples
    match triple {
        // Destructure the second and third elements
        (0, y, z) => println!("First is `0`, `y` is {:?}, and `z` is {:?}", y, z),
        (1, ..)  => println!("First is `1` and the rest doesn't matter"),
        (.., 2)  => println!("last is `2` and the rest doesn't matter"),
        (3, .., 4)  => println!("First is `3`, last is `4`, and the rest doesn't matter"),
        // `..` can be used to ignore the rest of the tuple
        _      => println!("It doesn't matter what they are"),
        // `_` means don't bind the value to a variable
    }
    
    // array
    match array {
        // Binds the second and the third elements to the respective variables
        [0, second, third] =>
            println!("array[0] = 0, array[1] = {}, array[2] = {}", second, third),

        // Single values can be ignored with _
        [1, _, third] => println!(
            "array[0] = 1, array[2] = {} and array[1] was ignored",
            third
        ),

        // You can also bind some and ignore the rest
        [-1, second, ..] => println!(
            "array[0] = -1, array[1] = {} and all the other ones were ignored",
            second
        ),
        // The code below would not compile
        // [-1, second] => ...

        // Or store them in another array/slice (the type depends on
        // that of the value that is being matched against)
        [3, second, tail @ ..] => println!(
            "array[0] = 3, array[1] = {} and the other elements were {:?}",
            second, tail
        ),

        // Combining these patterns, we can, for example, bind the first and
        // last values, and store the rest of them in a single array
        [first, middle @ .., last] => println!(
            "array[0] = {}, middle = {:?}, array[2] = {}",
            first, middle, last
        ),
    }
    
    // enum
    match color {
        Color::Red   => println!("The color is Red!"),
        Color::Blue  => println!("The color is Blue!"),
        Color::Green => println!("The color is Green!"),
        Color::RGB(r, g, b) =>
            println!("Red: {}, green: {}, and blue: {}!", r, g, b),
        Color::HSV(h, s, v) =>
            println!("Hue: {}, saturation: {}, value: {}!", h, s, v),
        Color::HSL(h, s, l) =>
            println!("Hue: {}, saturation: {}, lightness: {}!", h, s, l),
        Color::CMY(c, m, y) =>
            println!("Cyan: {}, magenta: {}, yellow: {}!", c, m, y),
        Color::CMYK(c, m, y, k) =>
            println!("Cyan: {}, magenta: {}, yellow: {}, key (black): {}!",
                c, m, y, k),
        // Don't need another arm because all variants have been examined
    }
    
	// pointers and references
    // Assign a reference of type `i32`. The `&` signifies there
    // is a reference being assigned.
    let reference = &4;

    match reference {
        // If `reference` is pattern matched against `&val`, it results
        // in a comparison like:
        // `&i32`
        // `&val`
        // ^ We see that if the matching `&`s are dropped, then the `i32`
        // should be assigned to `val`.
        &val => println!("Got a value via destructuring: {:?}", val),
    }

    // To avoid the `&`, you dereference before matching.
    match *reference {
        val => println!("Got a value via dereferencing: {:?}", val),
    }

    // What if you don't start with a reference? `reference` was a `&`
    // because the right side was already a reference. This is not
    // a reference because the right side is not one.
    let _not_a_reference = 3;

    // Rust provides `ref` for exactly this purpose. It modifies the
    // assignment so that a reference is created for the element; this
    // reference is assigned.
    let ref _is_a_reference = 3;

    // Accordingly, by defining 2 values without references, references
    // can be retrieved via `ref` and `ref mut`.
    let value = 5;
    let mut mut_value = 6;

    // Use `ref` keyword to create a reference.
    match value {
        ref r => println!("Got a reference to a value: {:?}", r),
    }

    // Use `ref mut` similarly.
    match mut_value {
        ref mut m => {
            // Got a reference. Gotta dereference it before we can
            // add anything to it.
            *m += 10;
            println!("We added 10. `mut_value`: {:?}", m);
        },
    }	
    
    struct Foo {
        x: (u32, u32),
        y: u32,
    }

    // structs
    let foo = Foo { x: (1, 2), y: 3 };

    match foo {
        Foo { x: (1, b), y } => println!("First of x is 1, b = {},  y = {} ", b, y),

        // you can destructure structs and rename the variables,
        // the order is not important
        Foo { y: 2, x: i } => println!("y is 2, i = {:?}", i),

        // and you can also ignore some variables:
        Foo { y, .. } => println!("y = {}, we don't care about x", y),
        // this will give an error: pattern does not mention field `x`
        //Foo { y } => println!("y = {}", y),
    }
}
```

### Guards
```rust
enum Temperature {
    Celsius(i32),
    Fahrenheit(i32),
}

fn main() {
    let temperature = Temperature::Celsius(35);

    match temperature {
        Temperature::Celsius(t) if t > 30 => println!("{}C is above 30 Celsius", t),
        // The `if condition` part ^ is a guard
        Temperature::Celsius(t) => println!("{}C is equal to or below 30 Celsius", t),

        Temperature::Fahrenheit(t) if t > 86 => println!("{}F is above 86 Fahrenheit", t),
        Temperature::Fahrenheit(t) => println!("{}F is equal to or below 86 Fahrenheit", t),
    }
}
```

### Binding
```rust
fn age() -> u32 {
    15
}

fn main() {
    println!("Tell me what type of person you are");

    match age() {
        0             => println!("I haven't celebrated my first birthday yet"),
        // Could `match` 1 ..= 12 directly but then what age
        // would the child be?
        // Could `match` n and use an `if` guard, but would
        // not contribute to exhaustiveness checks.
        // (Although in this case that would not matter since
        // a "catch-all" pattern is present at the bottom)
        // Instead, bind to `n` for the sequence of 1 ..= 12.
        // Now the age can be reported.
        n @ 1  ..= 12 => println!("I'm a child of age {:?}", n),
        n @ 13 ..= 19 => println!("I'm a teen of age {:?}", n),
        // A similar binding can be done when matching several values.
        n @ (1 | 7 | 15 | 13) => println!("I'm a teen of age {:?}", n),
        // Nothing bound. Return the result.
        n             => println!("I'm an old person of age {:?}", n),
    }
}
```


## If Let
If the let expression succeeds, evaluate the block with that let

```rust
fn main() {
    // All have type `Option<i32>`
    let number = Some(7);
    let letter: Option<i32> = None;
    let emoticon: Option<i32> = None;

    // The `if let` construct reads: "if `let` destructures `number` into
    // `Some(i)`, evaluate the block (`{}`).
    if let Some(i) = number {
        println!("Matched {:?}!", i);
    }

    // If you need to specify a failure, use an else:
    if let Some(i) = letter {
        println!("Matched {:?}!", i);
    } else {
        // Destructure failed. Change to the failure case.
        println!("Didn't match a number. Let's go with a letter!");
    }

    // Provide an altered failing condition.
    let i_like_letters = false;

    if let Some(i) = emoticon {
        println!("Matched {:?}!", i);
    // Destructure failed. Evaluate an `else if` condition to see if the
    // alternate failure branch should be taken:
    } else if i_like_letters {
        println!("Didn't match a number. Let's go with a letter!");
    } else {
        // The condition evaluated false. This branch is the default:
        println!("I don't like letters. Let's go with an emoticon :)!");
  
```


```rust
// Our example enum
enum Foo {
    Bar,
    Baz,
    Qux(u32)
}

fn main() {
    // Create example variables
    let a = Foo::Bar;
    let b = Foo::Baz;
    let c = Foo::Qux(100);

    // Variable a matches Foo::Bar
    if let Foo::Bar = a {
        println!("a is foobar");
    }

    // Variable b does not match Foo::Bar
    // So this will print nothing
    if let Foo::Bar = b {
        println!("b is foobar");
    }

    // Variable c matches Foo::Qux which has a value
    // Similar to Some() in the previous example
    if let Foo::Qux(value) = c {
        println!("c is {}", value);
    }

    // Binding also works with `if let`
    if let Foo::Qux(value @ 100) = c {
        println!("c is one hundred");
    }
}
```

## Let Else
allows for a fallback from let if it doesnt workout

```rust
use std::str::FromStr;

fn get_count_item(s: &str) -> (u64, &str) {
    let mut it = s.split(' ');
    let (Some(count_str), Some(item)) = (it.next(), it.next()) else {
        panic!("Can't segment count item pair: '{s}'");
    };
    let Ok(count) = u64::from_str(count_str) else {
        panic!("Can't parse integer: '{count_str}'");
    };
    (count, item)
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(get_count_item("3 chairs"), (3, "chairs"));
}
```

## While let
similar to if let, while 'let' expression succeeds, keep looping with it.
```rust
fn main() {
    // Make `optional` of type `Option<i32>`
    let mut optional = Some(0);

    // This reads: "while `let` destructures `optional` into
    // `Some(i)`, evaluate the block (`{}`). Else `break`.
    while let Some(i) = optional {
        if i > 9 {
            println!("Greater than 9, quit!");
            optional = None;
        } else {
            println!("`i` is `{:?}`. Try again.", i);
            optional = Some(i + 1);
        }
        // ^ Less rightward drift and doesn't require
        // explicitly handling the failing case.
    }
    // ^ `if let` had additional optional `else`/`else if`
    // clauses. `while let` does not have these.
}
```
