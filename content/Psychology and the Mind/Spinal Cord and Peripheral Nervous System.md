# **Spinal Cord and Peripheral Nervous System**

## **Intro to Neuroanatomy**
- **Planes of Section**:
    - **Sagittal**: divides left/right.
    - **Coronal**: divides front/back.
    - **Horizontal (axial)**: divides top/bottom.
- **Directional Terms**:
    - **Rostral (anterior)** = toward front.
    - **Caudal (posterior)** = toward back.
    - **Dorsal (superior)** = upward. (unless looking at spine, then dorsal is pointing out of your back)
    - **Ventral (inferior)** = downward.
    - **Medial** = toward midline; **lateral** = away from midline.
- **Ipsilateral**: same side.
- **Contralateral**: opposite side.

## **Spinal Cord Anatomy**
- **CNS** = brain + spinal cord.
  - Brain includes [[Brainstem and Midbrain|brainstem]], [[Forebrain and Cortical Structure|forebrain structures]]
- **PNS** = spinal nerves + cranial nerves.
- Spinal cord ends around **L1 vertebra**.
- Nerves extend downward as the **cauda equina**.
### **Spinal Nerve Organization**
- **Cervical (C1–C8)**
- **Thoracic (T1–T12)**
- **Lumbar (L1–L5)**
- **Sacral (S1–S5)**
- **Coccygeal (Co1–Co3)**

## **Spinal Cord and Reflexes**
- **Spinal Nerves** branch from the spinal cord. Each has two roots:
    - **Dorsal root** → carries **afferent sensory fibers** into spinal cord. Cell bodies sit in the **dorsal root ganglion**.
    - **Ventral root** → carries **efferent motor fibers** out to muscles. Motor neuron cell bodies are in the spinal cord's gray matter.
- Together, dorsal + ventral roots form a **mixed spinal nerve**.
### **Simple Reflex Arc**
- Example: **Triceps reflex (deep tendon reflex)**.
    - A stretch receptor in the muscle sends signal via sensory neuron → spinal cord.
    - Synapses directly onto a motor neuron → causes contraction.
- Reflexes are fast, involuntary, and involve minimal circuitry.

## **Cranial Nerves**
- 12 pairs, some sensory, some motor, some mixed:
    - I. **Olfactory** – smell
    - II. **Optic** – vision
    - III. **Oculomotor** – eye movement, pupil control
    - IV. **Trochlear** – eye movement
    - V. **Trigeminal** – facial sensation, jaw muscles
    - VI. **Abducens** – eye movement
    - VII. **Facial** – taste, facial expression
    - VIII. **Auditory (vestibulocochlear)** – hearing, balance
    - IX. **Glossopharyngeal** – taste, throat & larynx muscles
    - X. **Vagus** – internal organs
    - XI. **Accessory** – neck muscles
    - XII. **Hypoglossal** – tongue movements

## **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) Divisions**
1. **Somatic Nervous System** – voluntary control of skeletal muscles.
2. **Autonomic Nervous System** – involuntary control of organs, glands, smooth muscle.
    - Subdivisions:
        - **Sympathetic** ("fight or flight"): pupil dilation, bronchodilation, ↑ HR, ↓ digestion, orgasm, stress hormone release.
        - **Parasympathetic** ("rest and digest"): pupil constriction, salivation, ↓ HR, ↑ digestion, bladder relaxation, sexual arousal.
    - Neurotransmitters:
        - Sympathetic: preganglionic ACh, postganglionic norepinephrine.
        - Parasympathetic: preganglionic ACh, postganglionic ACh.
3. **Enteric Nervous System** – controls digestion independently, but modulated by sympathetic/parasympathetic inputs.

## **Meninges**
- Protective layers surrounding brain and spinal cord:
    1. **Dura mater** (outer, tough)
    2. **Arachnoid membrane** (middle, web-like) → filled with **CSF in subarachnoid space**
    3. **Pia mater** (inner, thin, hugs brain surface)
- Infections:
    - **Meningitis** = meninges infection → swelling, pressure on brain.
    - **Encephalitis** = infection of brain tissue itself.

## **Blood Supply**
- Supplied via **Circle of Willis**: anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries, plus basilar and internal carotid arteries.
- Veins drain into **dural venous sinuses** → internal jugular vein.
- Critical for preventing ischemia (strokes).

## **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and Ventricular System**
- **Produced by the choroid plexus** inside ventricles.
- Pathway: lateral ventricles → 3rd ventricle → cerebral aqueduct → 4th ventricle → central canal & subarachnoid space → absorbed into dural sinuses via arachnoid villi.
- Functions: cushions brain, regulates chemical environment, removes waste, spreads neuromodulators, supports neurogenesis.
- Disorders:
    - **Hydrocephalus** = CSF buildup → enlarged ventricles, compressed brain tissue.
