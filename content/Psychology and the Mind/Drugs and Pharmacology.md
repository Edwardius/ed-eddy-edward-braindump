## **Drugs and Toxins at the Synapse**
### **Preventing Action Potentials**
- **Local anesthetics (Novocain)** and **tetrodotoxin (pufferfish)** block **Na⁺ channels**.
- Without sodium influx, no action potential can propagate.
### **Preventing Neurotransmitter Release**
- **Spider venoms** (e.g., funnel-web spider) block **Ca²⁺ channels** → no vesicle fusion.
- **Botulinum toxin (BoNT, Botox)** interferes with **SNARE proteins** → blocks exocytosis, reduces neurotransmitter release.    
### **Increasing Neurotransmitter Release**
- **Black widow spider venom** (latrotoxin):
    - Creates pores for Ca²⁺ influx and neurotransmitter leakage.
    - Massive ACh release → muscle spasms.
- **Amphetamines & methamphetamine**:
    - Reverse transporters (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin).
    - Increase vesicular release.
    - Block uptake into vesicles.
    - Net effect: **more neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft**.
    - **Adderall** produces prolonged dopamine release compared to isomers.
### **Preventing Reuptake**
- **Cocaine, Ritalin, antidepressants**: block transporters for dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.
- Leads to **increased levels in the synaptic cleft**.
### **Preventing Deactivation**
- **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)**: block MAO enzyme, preventing breakdown of monoamines.
- **Organophosphates (pesticides)**: block acetylcholinesterase → ACh accumulates, causing overstimulation.
### **Blocking Receptors**
- Some **antipsychotics** block serotonin receptors (e.g., clozapine).
- **Black mamba venom** blocks muscarinic ACh receptors → paralysis.
### **Stimulating Receptors**
- **LSD** → binds serotonin receptors.
- **Nicotine** → binds nicotinic ACh receptors.
- **Opiates (morphine, heroin)** → bind endorphin receptors.
### **Mimicking Retrograde Transmitters**
- **THC (marijuana)** mimics **endocannabinoids** (anandamide, 2-AG).
- Binds presynaptic **cannabinoid receptors** → inhibits Ca²⁺ channels, reducing neurotransmitter release.
- Chronic cannabis use can cause long-term cognitive impairments (attention, memory, information processing).

## **Ketamine and Antidepressant Action**
- **Ketamine** acts on **glutamate neurotransmission**.
- Mechanism:
    1. Blocks **NMDA receptors** on **GABAergic interneurons** → reduces inhibition.
    2. Leads to **increased glutamate release** from excitatory neurons.
    3. Enhances **AMPA receptor activation** on glutamatergic neurons.
    4. Metabolized into **hydroxynorketamine (HNK)**, which also contributes to effects.
- Overall effect: disinhibition and enhanced glutamate signaling, linked to its **rapid antidepressant properties**.

## **Caffeine**
- Works through **adenosine receptors**:
    - Normally, **adenosine A1** receptors reduce excitatory release.
    - **A2A** receptors dampen dopamine receptor activity.
- **Caffeine blocks A1 and A2A receptors** → increases neurotransmitter release and dopamine activity.
- Also:
    - Releases Ca²⁺ from internal stores.
    - Interferes with GABA receptors (reduces inhibition).
- Result: **stimulant effect** (increased alertness, arousal).

## **Alcohol (Ethanol)**
- Complex, **non-selective pharmacological effects**:
    - Inhibits **voltage-gated Ca²⁺** channels (reduces release).
    - Affects **K⁺ channels**.
    - Binds to **ionotropic receptors** (ACh, serotonin, GABA, glutamate).
    - Enhances **adenosine signaling** (slows neural activity).
    - Interferes with **metabotropic receptors**, cell membranes, and even **gene expression**.
- General effect: **reduces neurotransmitter release** and inhibits postsynaptic activity.

## **Tolerance and Withdrawal**
- With repeated use, the brain **compensates** for drug effects (neural adaptation).
- **Tolerance**: same dose produces smaller effect.
- **Withdrawal**: opposite effect when drug is absent.
- Environmental cues can trigger anticipatory compensatory responses (classical conditioning).

## **Opioids (Morphine Example)**
- Bind to **μ (mu) opioid receptors**.
- Mechanism:
    - G-protein activation inhibits **Ca²⁺ channels** (less release) and opens **K⁺ channels** (hyperpolarization).
    - Over time: receptors become **desensitized** via phosphorylation and arrestin signaling.
- Strongly affect the **mesolimbic dopamine system**:
    - Dopaminergic neurons in the **ventral tegmental area (VTA)** project to the **nucleus accumbens**.
    - This circuit underlies **reward and addiction**.

## **Addiction and Reward Pathways**
- **Olds & Milner (1954)**: rats pressed levers thousands of times to self-stimulate the **septal area** → discovery of "pleasure centers."
- This parallels modern dopamine reward circuitry:
    - VTA → nucleus accumbens pathway.
    - Strongly activated by drugs, but also exploited by modern tech (e.g., Facebook's "dopamine hit" model for likes).
- Addiction = hijacking of natural reward systems → compulsive behavior despite consequences.

## **Brain Changes in Addiction**
- **Cocaine users** show reduced glucose metabolism in the **prefrontal cortex**.
- Indicates impaired executive function, decision-making, and impulse control.
- Addiction is not just chemical but also **structural and functional brain change**.
